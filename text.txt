Most individuals dont think about numbers,
or numerical representations of quantity,
but they play a major part in everyday life. To be sure,
numbers determine the time individuals
will wake up in the morning,
how much money employees earn per hour,
what day of the year it is, and much, much more.

Specifically, the legend behind Christmas is that Santa Claus,
a bearded, hefty, jolly, and red-jacket-wearing
old man who lives in the North Pole, spends the year
crafting presents with his elves, or small, festive,
excited Santa-assistants. All the children who behave
throughout the year are admitted to the Good List,
and will presumably receive their desired gifts on Christmas,
while those who dont behave are placed on the
Naughty List, and will presumably receive a lump of coal.

Valentine Day is a holiday that, in the United States
takes place on February 14, and technically signifies
the accomplishments of St. Valentine, a third-century Roman saint.
With that said, most Americans, instead of honoring St. Valentine
through religious ceremony, enjoy the holiday by
engaging in romantic behavior with their significant
other or someone who they wish to be their significant
other, gifts, special dinners, and other acknowledgements
of affection comprise most individuals Valentines Day celebrations.
